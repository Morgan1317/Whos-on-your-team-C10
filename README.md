  ## Description

  Whos on your team allows a manager to utilize the terminal and add members on their team, including themselves. An html file is generated, and from that file it allows the manager to access the employees, emails, and githubs with ease, without having to look them up everytime.

  ** Limitations
  
  Although there is some validation, there is not yet validation in place to verify user input an actual number, or that the id's and other inputs don't over lap, so currently there could be more than one member with the same ID. In the future, I plan to go back and add these validations to make the code a little more solid. 

  ## Tests

  To run tests, run the following command:

  ~~~
  npm run test
